# CORS
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism that allows web applications to make requests across different domains. However, misconfigured CORS policies can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data, perform unauthorized actions, and escalate privileges.
This repository provides in-depth knowledge, exploitation techniques, and PoCs to help ethical hackers and security researchers identify and exploit insecure CORS implementations.

# USES

"AFTER FINDING VULNERABLE URLS USING specors.py then use cors-exploit.py"



``python cors-exploit.py -t "https://victim.com/api" -a "evil.attacker.com"``

``python cors-exploit.py -t "https://victim.com/api" -a "evil.attacker.com" -c "your_session_cookie"``

``python cors-exploit.py -t "https://victim.com/api" -a "evil.attacker.com" -H "Authorization: Bearer XYZ123" "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest"``


# SPECORS.PY
This tool helps security researchers detect **CORS misconfigurations** in web applications. It performs **fast, multi-threaded scanning** using multiple HTTP methods to identify security risks that allow unauthorized access.

Features:
---------
‚úî Scans single URLs or bulk URLs from a file (`urls.txt`).  
‚úî Uses **GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, PATCH** for accurate detection.  
‚úî Checks headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Credentials`, and `Methods`.  
‚úî **Multi-threaded scanning** for speed and efficiency.  
‚úî **Saves vulnerable URLs** for further analysis.  
‚úî **Colorful UI** for an improved user experience.  

Usage:
------
1Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script and choose **single URL** or **multiple URLs from a file**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The tool will **automatically scan for CORS vulnerabilities**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ If vulnerabilities are found, they will be **displayed in red** and optionally saved to a file.
