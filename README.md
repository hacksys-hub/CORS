# CORS
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism that allows web applications to make requests across different domains. However, misconfigured CORS policies can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data, perform unauthorized actions, and escalate privileges.
This repository provides in-depth knowledge, exploitation techniques, and PoCs to help ethical hackers and security researchers identify and exploit insecure CORS implementations.
